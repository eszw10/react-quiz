# react-quiz

The React Quiz project is a simple and engaging quiz app built using React, leveraging the power of the useReducer hook for efficient state management. The application allows users to take a quiz, answer multiple-choice questions, and see their results at the end.

The key feature of this app is the use of the useReducer hook, which enhances state management by providing a more predictable way of handling complex state logic. This approach allows for better control over quiz states, such as user answers, current question index, and final score.

## Key Features:

- Multiple Questions: The quiz consists of multiple-choice questions, and the user can navigate through each question.
- State Management: Uses useReducer to manage quiz state, including question index, user responses, and score.
- Results Display: After completing the quiz, users can view their score and performance.
- Improved Maintainability: The reducer function helps keep the state logic isolated and easier to debug and maintain.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- useReducer Hook
- JavaScript (ES6+)

This app offers a great example of how to efficiently use useReducer for managing state in React applications, especially when dealing with complex state transitions.
